#### Socialize with me

You can follow the rss of Bonehead Media site through ActivityPub by using @BoneheadMedia@bots.tinysubversions.com - this is not a feed I can respond to, but for you to catch the feed updates on social media that use ActivityPub ie Mastodon.

[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@unklebonehead) | [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/unklebonehead) | [Email Me](mailto:unklebonehead@nixnet.email) | Hubzilla - I will get this back up when I get a vps.

***Mastodon is where you will find me the most. This is to interact with me on a one on one basis easiest.***

#### Subscribe in an Rss feed reader
***There is no tracking on this feed from me. Media files are stored on and downloaded from Archive.org.***
I am aware that the mp3 enclosures do not show in a proper podcast app such as AntennaePod. I am working on getting this fixed. For now a work around is to open the episodes shownotes in your mobile browser and just download or listen to it there.

***These apps do have tracking in them. They track download count, location and listening time. Well at least thats what they tell me about.***

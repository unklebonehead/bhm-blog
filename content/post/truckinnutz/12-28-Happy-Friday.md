Yesterday went to hell, wife broke her arm, the podcast is distributed to more places and I gotta fricking work this weekend. All that and more on trays episode! You can email me at unklebonehead@pm.me. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Minds.com etc. Do you have a question about truck driving and using the Anchor.fm app? Just send me a message right from the app and I am happy to answer anything!

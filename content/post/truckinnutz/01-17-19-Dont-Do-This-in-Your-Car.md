Today I talk about 5 things people do in a car around big trucks that can end up with deadly consequences. 
And no thats not a click bait headline. These things are very important to know

1. Dont pull in front of a truck only to make a left turn Dont Slow down to pass/speed up when being passed. 
Maintain your speed. 

2. Dont Pass only to slow down in front/pace truck from the front/”keep that driver from speeding” 
3. Dont Tailgate. You are essentially driving with a blindfold on. 
4. Dont Pass on right while a truck is turning right. We can not see you and will run over you! 
5. Doing things other than driving. We can see EVERYTHING in your car

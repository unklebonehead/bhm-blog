**I can assure you I am not slacking. I will be recordng a new episode this weekend while streaming on both [Dlive](https://dlive.tv/RealUnkleBonehead) and a test station I have been setting up for NTROradio. I would share the link for NTROradio with all of you but it's far from being ready for more than a few select people I trust to listen directly to my personal server. Lets just say that I have a friend with a lot of experience playing around with Azuracast and he is putting it through some tests. 

This weekend (most likely on Saturday afternoon/evening) I will have a public test stream for you to tune into. I may set that up live on Dlive but havent decided yet? It will be with a free service and you may have to leave a webpage open to listen and get inundated with stupid ads from that place. Not me. It will only be for testing purposes and I hope to get a couple of people to call me on JitsiMeet or something similar. 

Keep an eye open on Mastodon through the weekend to learn more!

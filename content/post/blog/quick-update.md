#### You can now follow just Bonehead Media on activitypub
Just search in your favorite activitypub app ie Mastodon, Hubzilla, etc for @BoneheadMedia@bots.tinysubversions.com
And you should be able to subscribe to this website's rss though activitypub. I used the [Feed Converter](https://bots.tinysubversions.com/) by [Darius Kazemi](https://friend.camp/@darius). It's a free service that he hosts and I hope to implement it on my own for others as he does once I get a VPS set up. 

I did this so I dont feel like I'm constantly barging into peoples timelines to share the updates on this site. If people want to see these posts on Mastodon then all they have to do is follow it! 

Have a great day or night depending on your timezone and remember to not stick your password where you wouldn't stick your face.

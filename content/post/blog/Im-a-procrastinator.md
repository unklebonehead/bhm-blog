## Or am I just to busy?
I've never really been one to just be able to boom, get things done. I do a lot of research on things that I'm interested in and then do them. Sometimes when it involves doing something I'm not really interested in I find it hard to concentrate on it. For example Lbry. I'm very much interested in being a creator on Lbry but I'm not interested in producing video, let alone even editing it. I know I can post other files such as markdown(as the one you are currently reading), and audio files. But I dont feel like that is as useful or attention getting as video is. The Lbry app is intended for video. And I have a face for audio, lol. 

So I have been learning a lot about video editing, production, and obcessing over all the different apps there are out there. I think I have narrowed it down to Olive Video Editor on the laptop and Vlogit on the phone. I even have a few ideas for videos to make. But problem is actually putting my plans into action. It seems that when my creative drive is in high gear that I am usually at work or have to start doing work. My work days are usually pretty long. 12-14 hours a day. By the end of the day I am usually wore out and just need to sit back and veg out on somebody elses content. Which then leads into my brain going into a completely different direction. Then the next day starts and the whole cycle repeats until I get home for my usual 1 and 1/2 day weekend. Where I have time to do some video producton. But I cant do it because I want to spend time with the family. The free time I do have is eary morning or overnight and in a house with thin walls I cant really talk to a camerea or microphone. This is really beginning to get annoying for me. 

But that may all change here soon. I was just going over some blood test results and my doctor may end up disquailfying me from driving truck. Which means I would end up having to do more office work. Which I suppose could lead to some more free time. I'm already working in the office for this week and I'm basicly living in the drivers lounge after hours. I'll make a video about it later today.

So, if you are a creator, what are some things you do to keep yourself on track for production? Do you have any tips to help me to stop obscessing over learning about production and just doing it?Hit me up either in the comments on Lbry or on [Discord](Unkle Bonehead 9292#9434).

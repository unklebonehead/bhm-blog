### So I did some thinking about my last post
After chewing on that last post for a couple of days I thought I should mention some good podcasts that done have the crap of the fluff taking up 50% of thier episodes. Now let me just say that these are not free from advertising. But the adverts in them are done tastefully and dont take up half the show. And they will actually respond to an email from someone who isnt a patron on patreon. I have tried to keep them in seperate categories or genres if you want to call them that. 

***And yes I included mine in this list. What I cant self promote?***

Irish born Darragh J Brady is a rock steady musician and writer who is not afraid to go out on the edge if it means bringing something good back from it.

Dar.Ra has graced the UK national charts and dance charts with two top 40’s and two number one dance records with acts signed to EMI, BMG, Festival Records (Australia) plus remixed legends like Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Tears 4 Fears, Urban Harmonix ft Rachel Brown (Faithless, Groove Armada) and many others along the way. 

He has lived his life in recording studios around the world making some amazing sonic masterpieces along the way, from Dance to Rock To World Music and back again, and runs his own record label Kusha Deep Music.

His first solo album ‘Soul Hours’ released in 2010 made album of the week of Spain’s Heart FM as well as received support from BBC Radio, playing to over 1 million people in one on air live show.

His follow up album ‘Battle Hymns’ has been used on various TV and Film projects from BBC’s Match Of The Day to US ABC TV films starring Hilary Duff.

Dar.Ra wrote and produced the music for US documentary ‘City of Hope” which told the story of the street kids of San Paulo, and how two Americans set up one of the most successful Schools, with literally no money.

The next EP titled Dirty Lil Secrets has some serious sonic adventures and big sound ambitions which aims to bring the story telling element back into the music. Crossing Rock,Soul,Reggae and Country music is a fine balance to get right but we feel with the help of co Producer Harvey Summers this has been achieved 100%.

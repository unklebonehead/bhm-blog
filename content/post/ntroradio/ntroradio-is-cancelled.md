#### Update as of 2019-10-5
##### I am currently researching how to get the stream back up for as cheap as possible. I will be returning the podcast soon and may well do some posts of artists as well. Keep and eye both here and [NTROradio](https://ntroradio.com)
I have cancelled NTROradio. Both the podcast and the station. The station was run on Radionomy and since they ceased operations in the USA and forced everybody to move to paid versions of Shoutcast I am unable to afford it. I still listen to every artist that was played and may continue to post articles about new ones I find in the future. But I dont have time to keep up with the podcast. So that is done. All older episodes will remain available to listen to as long as Anchor.fm doesnt die.
I am truly sorry to have to end it.

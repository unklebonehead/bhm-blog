## Main Topic
Do you know whats the coolest part of the opensource community? Having the ability to talk directly to the developers. You tend to find out that they are humans too. They are real people who have lives. They just have different skills than you or I. And they listen to what you have to say.

Case in point, Socialhome and Funkwhale.

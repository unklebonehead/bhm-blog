#### Other Links
[Nixnet](https://nixnet.xyz/) 

>NixNet.xyz is a network of websites and services hosted by the pseudonymous Amolith (me). The main reason I'm hosting these sites is because I like to be in control of my own data where feasible. The easiest way to accomplish this is to host the services I use. I make them public and and maintain them simply because I want to. The Linux and FLOSS community has completely changed my life and I feel like this is a small way I can do my part and give back.

He also has an awesome blog! Follow him on Mastodon or through ActivityPub at the link in the H/T.

I'm considering joining the [Federated Networks Association](https://feneas.org/) or at least supporting it.

**What they do**

>- Provide information about federated web projects
>- Arrange trainings and events
>- Provide travel grants to events
>- Use funds for marketing campaigns to promote federated web projects
>- Use funds to sponsor development work of individuals working on federated web projects or directly donating funds to projects themselves

### Show topic - Makng some changes round here!
I started doing some blogging and one of the first posts was asking if I [should start another podcast](https://boneheadmedia.com/post/blog/considering-a-new-podcast/). Well after asking on Hubzilla a couple of you actually responded stating that I should just use this podcast. And after considering it for the last 4-5 days. 
I'm gonna man up and say RockyIII and Oros you are right! I do already have the right podcast for it. No need to start a new one. 
Even though I started the podcast with the intention of highlighting Yunohost there is no reason why I cant just cover the Fediverse.

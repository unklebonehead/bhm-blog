#### Pre-roll
The last couple of weeks I've seen on these message signs over the highways the phrase "Turn signals-the original instant message". And the talk on the CB radio was hilarious as you can imagine. But the one thing all of us truck drivers agree on is that the turn signal is not the original instant messsage. It's the middle finger. And speaking of instant messenges this is Ep10:Communication on Yunohost  right here, right now on The Self Hosted Podcast.


#### Housekeeping
Just a few quick things to go over before we get started.

- I've updated the front page of [Bonehead Media](https://boneheadmedia.com). It's now just a static html landing page. The show notes for (eventually) all of the podcasts will be on the [posts](https://posts.boneheadmedia.com). 

- I started a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/unklebonehead) and [Librepay](https://liberapay.com/UnkleBonehead/donate) pages to get some funding for a vps.

- I'm trying to get [NTROradio](https://ntroradio.com) back up and running. I want it to be a 24/7 station that I can go live with anytime I want to. I would eventually like to have it so that other people from other staions can either jump on live or syndicate their shows on. I already have the site up but it only streams when I am live. I cant seem to get any player to work but you can at least listen to the link in VLC, Rhythmbox, Clementine or any app that supports a stream link. The link will also play in a seperate tab. It's going to have a podcast to go with it.

#### Please help me if you can
I've been hosting all my content at home on my personal server but I will soon be out of room on it and the network traffic is almost too much for it to handle. If you can spare a little change and throw it my way I would appreciate it alot. I'm only looking for $60-$70 for a years worth of hosting. Any amount over and beyond that will be donated to an awesome open source project that you the listeners and contributors will vote on.

**Moving really sucks. Gotta pack everything up in boxes, Bubble wrap all the breakables... what? Yes I think I found a new home. It's called Socialhome and its right here on episode 22 of The Self Hosted Podcast**.

Special thank you to [Nachbarscaft](https://bildung.social/@Nachbarschaft) for the proof that it works. I had thought of this before but didnt try it because I thought it wouldnt work but I am wrong and it does work!

- I'm now on [Socialhome](https://socialhome.network/u/unklebonehead/) and absolutly love it! @unklebonehead@socialhome.netwrok More on Socialhome to come.

My ultimate goal is to move boneheadmedia to Socialhome and make it my personal site such as [Jason Robinson](https://jasonrobinson.me/) has done. He is one of the devs of Socialhome and has made it look just like a website. 

-Funkwhale podcast update. I've seen some wireframes that have been done up to show what its going to look like and they are beautiful! I cant wait to make my podcasts all available on the Fediverse! I'm excited as hell!

#### News
[OpusMT](http://opusmt.wmflabs.org/) - An open source alternative to Google Translate has gotten started.

[Fediverse Party 2019 review](https://www.fediverse.party/en/post/fediverse-in-2019)

##### Some interesting Numbers
- 1000 new servers online

- 1.8 million newcommers

- Top 5 servers growth was Pleroms, Mastodon, WriteFreely, Pixelfed and PeerTube.

- Misskey, Plume and Funkwhale grew as well

- 13 new networks expressed a wish to become part of Fediverse!

- But the big problem still remains. People are still flocking to big servers and not enough small ones. Reminder that the idea of decntralized is everybody hosts their own. Which I understand is not feaseable for most people. 

#### Socialhome

[Socialhome](https://socialhome.network) is best described as a #federated personal profile with social networking functionality. Users can create rich content using #Markdown. All content can be pinned to the user profile and all content will federate to contacts in the federated social web. Federation happens using the #ActivityPub and #Diaspora protocols.

**IMHO Pros**

- Looks very cool and is easy on the eyes to read.

- Uses markdown for posts with a preview available.

- Ability to pin content so that you can make it look like a personal website which is what I want to do with Bonehead Media. Just need a VPS to put it on. 

- Choice of 6 different streams to follow. Followed, Public, Tags, Local, Limited and MyContent.

- Very easy to follow other people

- Similar to Hubzilla and is easier to use than it. Because it doesnt try to do everything that Hubzilla does.

- Has a command line client that is available as a snap app.

- Works somewhat well in Firefox mobile.

**IMHO Cons**
- Currently **NO** desktop or android apps in development.

- Needs a dark mode! Way too bright especially in a dark room.

- There are currently on 6 nodes, 1352 users, 23217 postsand 3794 comments. So I would love to see more people use it. 

I think I'm going to stay with it and not return to Hubzilla for the time being. This is exactly what I've benn looking for. A place to put my regular content and be social all at the same time in the same place.

#### I'm the in The Funkwhale Community Spotlight!
I was asked to be in the spotlight of the Funkwhale community. So of course I said yes. You can go read it [hear](https://blog.funkwhale.audio/~/Community/funkwhale-community-spotlight-unkle-bonehead).

I thought that since this is a podcast and I am a podcaster that I should just do an audio version of it. So I had Casey ask me the questions and hit record. I thought this would be good since I do have a couple of blind friends that listen and I hope they appreciate it.

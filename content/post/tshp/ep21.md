**Its a new year and now is the perfect time for you to make the commitment to protecting yourself, your privacy and your data. How? By self hosting of course! Self hosted radio station, websites and files and detoxing your data all right here, right now on The Self Hosted Podcast!**

#### Banter
Over the last 20 episodes I've focussed primarily on apps that can be installed and used through Yunohost. I've also tried to learn how to install apps on my Yunohost server but that was a complete bust. I just aint smart enough. But I did get one installed without using Yunohost and it actually works! If your one of the lucky ones (friends and family) you might be listening to this being recorded live or a replay on it right now. It's called Azuracast and I am excited as hell to have it installe and running. More on that later but first lets get to the news!

### The Deets
**Please help me if you can**

I've been hosting all my content at home on my personal server but I will soon be out of room on it and the network traffic is almost too much for it to handle. If you can spare a little change and throw it my way I would appreciate it alot. I'm only looking for $60-$70 for a years worth of hosting.

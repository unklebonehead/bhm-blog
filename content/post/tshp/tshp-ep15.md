### Password Managers
Unfourtunately there is only one in the Yunohost repos. And that is Keeweb. Which is a web based manager that also has a desktop app. It says it is compatable with Keepass so I'm gonna test it out. 

I installed and I really dont know what to do, lol. I've got some experience using LastPass a long time ago but just gave up on it because I turned into one of those lazy people saying "I've got nothing to hide, blah, blah". That was before I found out how much of a product we really are. Holy shit! I just realized that the movie The Matrix is true!

I ran search for Open Source password managers and came up with theses.

- Bitwarden - self hosted or use someone else

- KeePass - Desktop

- KeepassX - Fork of KeePass

- KeeWeb - Self hosted

Since I literally just installed KeePass and KeeWeb this morning I will have to get back to you on how to use them. From my intial glance KeePass is very similar to LastPass. You set up a main password and then use it to generate strong passwords for everything. Copy pasta the password into what ever you need. 

I'm guessing you can use KeeWeb simialr to the centralized stuff like Lastpass only for this case it would be for KeePass. I wonder if it would work for Bitwarden as weel? 

I did jsut notice that in KeeWeb it says that it does exactly what I thought! Yay, I know how to read!

But what I dont undetstand is the webdav, dropbox, google drive, onedrive and insert link icons. I'm guessing those would be places you have your database saved at?

I'm gonna give it a go over the next couple of weeks and see if I can get myself a little bit safer. You should too!

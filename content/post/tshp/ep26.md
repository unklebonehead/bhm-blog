## Let's get busy!

I know, I know, it's fricking Twitter. But...

Heard this on a Discord chat earlier.
> You gotta get your boots dirty if you're gonna pull people out of the mud!

If you are on it follow me. I will do my best to actually post on it.

I hear rumors that Lbry is working on a Lbry to YouTube sync. I could get behind that.

You may notice some changes here in the podcast. For instance, no music. No more fluff. No more flashy pizzazy stuff. And here is why. I'm making a more concerted effort to produce videos on Lbry. I know that in this crazy, fast paced world we live in people dont have time to listen to same crap repeated over and over. Every damn episode. So I'm gonna cut the fluff and just get into it. 
Especially since I am planning on doing 3 frickin podcasts this year, lol. So if you want to hear music and fluff listen to NTROradio. I'm hoping this will allow me to do more episodes per week rather than just one every week or two.  

I even made new overlays and scenes for the videos. And am producing them much as I do the audio. By doing as little editing as possibile. And the Bonehead Media logo got an overhaul as well. 

Speaking of Lbry I ran across [this today](https://lbry.fund/creator)

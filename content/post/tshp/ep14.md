#### So I got started on FreeCodeCamp
As I mentioned in a blog post last week I want to learn how to code. Mainly so I can understand the topics I am covering here on this podcast and to help me be a better self hoster but I would love to get a new job where I am home a lot more than just 34 hrs a week.
I forgot that I had started learning some css back in 2015. Sadly I never finished learning over there. I could've had a different job already and being home everyday by now. But I am very serious about this now. You can follow my progress on [my profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/unklebonehead). It is funny that they have links for your Twitter and LinkedIn profiles but I subsituted my Hubzilla for the Twitter profile and it links to the right place!
#### Links
[Pubcast](https://pubcast.pub/) - Pubcast is an open-source, experimental replacement for RSS built on ActivityPub.

Pubcast is two things.

- First, Pubcast is a technology, like email. That means anyone can write a Pubcast app or talk to another pubcast app. Second, Pubcast is a web server, that anyone can spin up. These servers can talk to each other over Pubcast's API. Okay cool

- Pubcast is both email and gmail. The Pubcast project builds the technology that allow people to listen to podcasts in a new way, but we also build a way for people to use it. But anyone can build their own Pubcast player, server, or website.

      <description>Who? Hi,I&amp;rsquo;m Unkle Bonehead aka Ryan Ridenour, I&amp;rsquo;m a 49 yr old truck driver by trade and have just over 27 years in the industry with over 2.5 million accident free miles. I create podcasts and other digital media. I am also an amateur self hoster, a Fediverse Evangelist and fanboy of the Yunohost server distribution based on Debian.
Digital audio I originally got into podcasting purely by accident while researching how to record my own music on the computer back in 2005.</description>

Pre-roll The last couple of weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve seen on these message signs over the highways the phrase &amp;ldquo;Turn signals-the original instant message&amp;rdquo;. And the talk on the CB radio was hilarious as you can imagine. But the one thing all of us truck drivers agree on is that the turn signal is not the original instant messsage. It&amp;rsquo;s the middle finger. And speaking of instant messenges this is Ep10:Communication on Yunohost right here, right now on The Self Hosted Podcast.</description>

      <description>To be honest, this should be a &amp;ldquo;Dont drink and vidcast&amp;rdquo; video. I may or may not have had a couple of beers before recording this. This how I record all of my podcasts, whether I&amp;rsquo;m at home in the studio or on the road in the truck. The process and apps are all the same.</description>

Housekeeping It seems that this podcasts goal has already been achieved. It has inspired 2 people to start self hosting. I got a couple of notifications on Mastodon that one is researching on how to self host on bsd and the other actually installed Yunohost! Thats frickin AWESOME! CONGRATS TO BOTH OF YOU! And I sincerely hope it works out for each your situations. Especially the one doing it on bsd.</description>

Housekeeping I just recorded episode 4 of The Self Hosted Vidcast. I uninstalled Wordpress and showed how to install a static html site on Yunohost. Bonehead Media is back to being a simple static html site. It&amp;rsquo;s only got 2 pages that I built in Bootstrap Studio. I&amp;rsquo;ll flesh it out more in the future. I would like to turn it into a theme for Pelican or Hugo and post the shownotes to the front page.</description>

How to take back control https://switching.social/guide-to-switching/
First we need to look at what we need to replace to rid our lives of these companies. 1. Communication/Email/Chat/Conferancing 2. Office/Doc/Colaboration 3. File storage/Sharing 4. News 5. Social Networking 6. Education 7. Entertainment
To truly get rid of Google you will need to replace your Android phone! More on this towards the end. These can all be covered using some ethical and free companies such as Framasoft.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be totally honest with you. I didnt really think the course of this podcast through before starting it. I got excited when I found out about Yunohost and went totally ADD thinking that people have to know about this distro! I just hit record and started talking without thinking. I didnt put any kind of structure into it or really any kind of planning.</description>

I was listening to one of the episodes as I usually do. Us podcasters do that alot. Listen to ourselves in order to critique our abililites. We&amp;rsquo;re not really that self important, we are are our worst and toughest critics.</description>

      <description>The step called &amp;ldquo;post-installation&amp;rdquo; is actually the initial configuration of YunoHost. It has to be done just after the installation of the system itself. You can do it from through ssh, directly on the server or through a web browser. The browser is what I did because it is the easiest for people like me. Who dont know what they are doing.

So I went and did it. But all in on this thing this time. I&amp;rsquo;ve embraced the &amp;ldquo;self hosting&amp;rdquo; concept and am running everything myself right down to the email.</description>

      <description>Another quick update is that I have put TruckinNutz on hiatus for a unknown amount of time. I have started a new podcast with the boys of Trucker Nation, USA called Break 19 Podcast. We have esentially merged the two together and have already recorded a couple of episodes. We intended it to be available as a videocast but I think we will end up just making it a good old fashioned audio podcast since the first couple of episodes have already turned out to be audio.</description>

I will be returning the podcast soon and may well do some posts of artists as well. Keep and eye both here and NTROradio I have cancelled NTROradio. Both the podcast and the station. The station was run on Radionomy and since they ceased operations in the USA and forced everybody to move to paid versions of Shoutcast I am unable to afford it.</description>

      <description>As I said in the intro this is just how I do it. Some of you might do it differently but this is the way I was taught. I’ve seen a lot of old timers do it this as well. And it also kinda helps with the eld since you have to show 7-12 minutes doing a pre trip. Here is my steps as if I am on the road for the week already.</description>

      <description>Why do people start a podcast? Some do it because its fun to talk. Others do it because there is subject that are passionate about and cant stop talking about it. But more and more I&amp;rsquo;m finding people starting podcasts with the intention of making money from that podcast. And I want to talk to you. Please, for the love of god. Stop! Podcasting started out as just people sharing on the internet.</description>

      <description>Let’s start with a question.
What is the most important thing on the truck? YOU!
Why?
Because you are important. Your family is depending on you. Your customers are depending on you. The general public is depending on you. You need to look at it as part of your job.
Can you safely operate that 40 ton truck?
Are you sick? Feel like throwing up? Don’t drive.
Are you tired?</description>

      <description>Today I talk about 5 things people do in a car around big trucks that can end up with deadly consequences. And no thats not a click bait headline. These things are very important to know
 Dont pull in front of a truck only to make a left turn Dont Slow down to pass/speed up when being passed. Maintain your speed.
 Dont Pass only to slow down in front/pace truck from the front/”keep that driver from speeding”</description>

      <description>Home time is the hardest. You get home and have to unwind. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be socialable. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk with anybody. Then when you do unwind and are ready to be socialable it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back into trucking mode and the depression and anxiety of having to leave sets in.</description>

      <description>EPISODE NOTES So just a disclaimer if this is the first episode you’ve ever heard there is most likely a cuss word or two that gets thrown out once or twice. So I apologize in advance. But I do try to keep the show family friendly. This week I’m going to talk about a well documented and well proven piece of technology called the Citizens Band Radio. It can help you with your daily work better than any app on any phone operating system.</description>

      <description>***Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: When I first published this episode I had the intention of no longer podcasting about music. Well, I changed my mind. ***
Hi, You know me and you know how much I love indie music. I am going to have to say that this is the hardest podcast episode I’ve ever recorded. As much as I love introducing people to new music and the amazing artists that create it I am going to bring it all to an end.</description>

      <description>So I did some thinking about my last post After chewing on that last post for a couple of days I thought I should mention some good podcasts that done have the crap of the fluff taking up 50% of thier episodes. Now let me just say that these are not free from advertising. But the adverts in them are done tastefully and dont take up half the show. And they will actually respond to an email from someone who isnt a patron on patreon.</description>

      <description>To be honest, this should be a &amp;ldquo;Dont drink and vidcast&amp;rdquo; video. I may or may not have had a couple of beers before recording this. This how I record all of my podcasts, whether I&amp;rsquo;m at home in the studio or on the road in the truck. The process and apps are all the same.</description>

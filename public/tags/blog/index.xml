      <description>In episode 21 of The Self Hosted Podcast I talked about IPFS. Well if you are reading this then I did it. This website is now on IPFS and you if I did it right it looks no different than the regular website. Which I hope I got it right because that would be so cool. But I still dont like that whatever you put on IPFS it&amp;rsquo;s online forever. So you better be sure you stand behind what you say and dont change your mind.</description>

      <description>I have to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m actually considering it You may have figured out by now that when I find something new the first thing I do is look for a podcast about it. I know I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one in the world that does this. But this time I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure about starting it. I want to do it but I dont want to, lol. I&amp;rsquo;m so indecisive.</description>

      <description>In case you hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed I&amp;rsquo;ve been a bit busy here recently. Not only has the entire site been redone but it&amp;rsquo;s still not complete. While it is complete enough to get going with new content. Here is what I&amp;rsquo;ve done. - Now made with Hugo! I went back to Hugo because I like the simplicity of it and how I can make changes right on my laptop during the week.</description>

      <description>This is huge. I mean super big huge!
So I am actually putting my money where my mouth is. I&amp;rsquo;ve been loathing the bull shit of Google, Facebook, Youtube and prettty much every large corporate giants out there that want to use its &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; as products to sell to their advertisers and shareholders. So I went and did it. But all in on this thing this time. I&amp;rsquo;ve embraced the &amp;ldquo;self hosting&amp;rdquo; concept and am running everything myself right down to the email.</description>

And it also kinda helps with the eld since you have to show 7-12 minutes doing a pre trip. Here is my steps as if I am on the road for the week already.</description>

      <description>In episode 21 of The Self Hosted Podcast I talked about IPFS. Well if you are reading this then I did it. This website is now on IPFS and you if I did it right it looks no different than the regular website. Which I hope I got it right because that would be so cool. But I still dont like that whatever you put on IPFS it&amp;rsquo;s online forever. So you better be sure you stand behind what you say and dont change your mind.</description>

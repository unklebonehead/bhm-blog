      <description>You can now follow just Bonehead Media on activitypub Just search in your favorite activitypub app ie Mastodon, Hubzilla, etc for @BoneheadMedia@bots.tinysubversions.com And you should be able to subscribe to this website&amp;rsquo;s rss though activitypub. I used the Feed Converter by Darius Kazemi. It&amp;rsquo;s a free service that he hosts and I hope to implement it on my own for others as he does once I get a VPS set up.</description>

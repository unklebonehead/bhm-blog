      <description>Another quick update is that I have put TruckinNutz on hiatus for a unknown amount of time. I have started a new podcast with the boys of Trucker Nation, USA called Break 19 Podcast. We have esentially merged the two together and have already recorded a couple of episodes. We intended it to be available as a videocast but I think we will end up just making it a good old fashioned audio podcast since the first couple of episodes have already turned out to be audio.</description>

      <description>Let’s start with a question.
What is the most important thing on the truck? YOU!
Why?
Because you are important. Your family is depending on you. Your customers are depending on you. The general public is depending on you. You need to look at it as part of your job.
Can you safely operate that 40 ton truck?
Are you sick? Feel like throwing up? Don’t drive.
Are you tired?</description>

 Dont pull in front of a truck only to make a left turn Dont Slow down to pass/speed up when being passed. Maintain your speed.
 Dont Pass only to slow down in front/pace truck from the front/”keep that driver from speeding”</description>

      <description>All Brokers Lie. It&amp;rsquo;s just a fact of our industry but drivers, even company drivers have got to stand up to them. Don&amp;rsquo;t let them just treat you like a second class citizen and work for free. You have the right to ask for detention pay. Talk with your companies dispatch! Also check out the Trucker Nation USA podcast. Another great podcast here on Anchor.fm</description>

      <description>Home time is the hardest. You get home and have to unwind. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to be socialable. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to talk with anybody. Then when you do unwind and are ready to be socialable it&amp;rsquo;s time to get back into trucking mode and the depression and anxiety of having to leave sets in.</description>

      <description>EPISODE NOTES So just a disclaimer if this is the first episode you’ve ever heard there is most likely a cuss word or two that gets thrown out once or twice. So I apologize in advance. But I do try to keep the show family friendly. This week I’m going to talk about a well documented and well proven piece of technology called the Citizens Band Radio. It can help you with your daily work better than any app on any phone operating system.</description>
